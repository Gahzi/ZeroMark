<p>Zero.Mark is a team-based top-down arena shooter featuring a unique scoring mechanic and capture-point area control. This project is currently in development and is updated every Thursday for testing purposes.</p>

<p>This is a networked multiplayer game in a very limited early beta access. To get the best idea of what this game is like please be sure to try it out with other players. Please feel free to contact us if you would like to schedule a participatory demonstration match.</p>
